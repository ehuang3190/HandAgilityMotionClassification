# Hand Agility Motion Classification
E96C Final Project for Fall 2020
The device has 3 directions of motion: left, right and up. Within each directions there is a "broken" classification (no rotation) and a "healthy" classificatio (rotation present). This is based off the assumption that a broken or damaged hand that the device is worn on will have reduced motion capabilities.
